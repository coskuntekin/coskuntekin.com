I have used and developed [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/). But now i am boring to use WordPress. However i decided to make the change.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) modify look like difficult and complicate, you'll spend more time for a simple page. So I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll pretty simple and hacker friendly. You can write a page at least in one hour.

If you wanna see this page's source code you can review on the
 [GitHub](https://github.com/coskuntekin/coskuntekin.github.com)

Welcome to Jekyll world.
